CNS/Brain	Diffuse Glioma	Glioblastoma Multiforme	PDGFRA	copy number gain	NA	PDGFRB	copy number gain	NA	"In this study, use of a detailed multicolor FISH mapping procedure in pathologic specimens revealed a mutual exclusivity of gene amplification in the majority of glioblastoma tumors examined. In particular, the two most commonly amplified RTK genes, EGFR and PDGFRA, were found to be present in variable proportions across the tumors, with one or the other gene predominating in certain areas of the same specimen."
